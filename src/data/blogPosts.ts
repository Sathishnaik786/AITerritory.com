# Building Your First AI Chatbot: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Creating an AI chatbot might seem like a complex task, but with the right tools and guidance, anyone can build a functional chatbot. Let's walk through the process step by step.

## Understanding Chatbots

A chatbot is a software application that can simulate human conversation. Modern chatbots use AI to understand user intent and provide relevant responses.

### Types of Chatbots

1. **Rule-based**: Follow predefined rules and patterns
2. **AI-powered**: Use machine learning to understand and respond
3. **Hybrid**: Combine rule-based and AI approaches

## Prerequisites

Before we start, you'll need:

- Basic knowledge of Python
- Understanding of APIs and HTTP requests
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Python 3.7+ installed

## Step 1: Choose Your Platform

For this tutorial, we'll use **Dialogflow** (Google's chatbot platform) as it's beginner-friendly and powerful.

### Alternative Platforms:
- **Microsoft Bot Framework**
- **IBM Watson Assistant**
- **Rasa** (open-source)
- **Chatfuel** (no-code)

## Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Install Python dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install dialogflow
pip install flask
pip install python-dotenv
\`\`\`

2. Create a new project directory:
\`\`\`bash
mkdir my-chatbot
cd my-chatbot
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Create a Dialogflow Agent

1. Go to [Dialogflow Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new agent
3. Set up basic intents (user intentions)
4. Configure responses

### Basic Intents to Create:
- **Greeting**: "Hello", "Hi", "Good morning"
- **Farewell**: "Goodbye", "See you", "Bye"
- **Help**: "Help", "What can you do?", "Support"

## Step 4: Build the Backend

Create a Flask application to handle webhook requests:

\`\`\`python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import dialogflow
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Extract user message
    user_message = data['queryResult']['queryText']
    
    # Process with Dialogflow
    response = process_message(user_message)
    
    return jsonify(response)

def process_message(message):
    # Initialize Dialogflow client
    session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient()
    session = session_client.session_path(
        os.getenv('GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID'), 
        'unique-session-id'
    )
    
    # Create text input
    text_input = dialogflow.TextInput(
        text=message, 
        language_code='en-US'
    )
    
    # Create query input
    query_input = dialogflow.QueryInput(text=text_input)
    
    # Get response
    response = session_client.detect_intent(
        session=session, 
        query_input=query_input
    )
    
    return {
        'fulfillmentText': response.query_result.fulfillment_text
    }

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
\`\`\`
