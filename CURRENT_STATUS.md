# Current Status - Blog Interactions API

## ✅ What's Working
- **Database tables exist**: `blog_likes`, `blog_bookmarks`, `blog_comments`, `blog_events`
- **Correct schema**: `blog_events` has `user_id` as `text` (correct for Clerk)
- **Server is running**: Port 8080 is active
- **API routes are configured**: Endpoints are accessible

## ❌ What's Not Working
- **500 Internal Server Error**: All API endpoints return 500 errors
- **Missing RLS Policies**: Tables exist but likely don't have proper Row Level Security policies
- **No response body**: Server errors are not providing detailed error messages

## 🔍 Root Cause
The database tables exist with correct schemas, but they're missing the required Row Level Security (RLS) policies that Supabase needs to allow access.

## 📋 Next Steps

### Step 1: Add RLS Policies
Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
-- Execute add_rls_policies.sql
```

### Step 2: Restart Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Endpoints
```bash
node test_api_endpoints.cjs
```

## Expected Results After Fix
- ✅ Blog comments API: `GET /api/blogs/:slug/comments/threaded` → 200 OK
- ✅ Blog likes API: `GET /api/interactions/blogs/:slug/likes/count` → 200 OK  
- ✅ Blog bookmarks API: `GET /api/interactions/blogs/:slug/bookmarks/count` → 200 OK
- ✅ Blog events tracking: No more 400 errors

## Files Created
- `add_rls_policies.sql` - Adds missing RLS policies
- `test_api_endpoints.cjs` - Tests API endpoints
- `test_server_directly.cjs` - Direct server testing
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - This summary

## Notes
- All database schemas are correct
- Server is running properly
- The issue is specifically missing RLS policies
- Once RLS policies are added, all functionality should work
