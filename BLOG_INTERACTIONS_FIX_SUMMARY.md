# Blog Interactions API Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **500 Internal Server Error on Blog Comments API**: `/api/blogs/:slug/comments/threaded`
2. **500 Internal Server Error on Blog Likes/Bookmarks API**: All interaction endpoints
3. **400 Bad Request on Blog Events API**: Supabase blog_events table missing

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Database Tables**: `blog_likes`, `blog_bookmarks`, `blog_comments`, and `blog_events` tables don't exist
2. **Incorrect Blog ID Format**: API was expecting UUIDs but database schema uses blog slugs
3. **Missing Threaded Comments Endpoint**: Frontend calls `/comments/threaded` but backend only had `/comments`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Fixes

Created `create_tables.sql` with the following tables:
- `blog_likes` - Stores blog likes with blog_id as text (slug)
- `blog_bookmarks` - Stores blog bookmarks with blog_id as text (slug)
- `blog_comments` - Stores blog comments with blog_id as text (slug)
- `blog_events` - Stores engagement tracking events

### 2. API Endpoint Fixes

#### Blog Comments Controller (`server/controllers/blogCommentsController.js`)
- ✅ Fixed to use blog slugs directly instead of UUIDs
- ✅ Added `getThreadedComments` function for `/comments/threaded` endpoint
- ✅ Updated routes to include threaded comments endpoint

#### Blog Comments Routes (`server/routes/blogComments.js`)
- ✅ Added `/threaded` route for threaded comments

#### Unified Interactions Controller (`server/controllers/unifiedInteractionsController.js`)
- ✅ Already correctly uses blog slugs for blog_id
- ✅ All blog interaction functions work with blog slugs directly

### 3. Database Tables Structure

All tables use `blog_id` as `text` (blog slug) instead of UUID:

```sql
-- Example structure for blog_likes
CREATE TABLE public.blog_likes (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  blog_id text NOT NULL, -- Blog slug
  user_id text NOT NULL, -- Clerk user ID
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  UNIQUE (blog_id, user_id)
);
```

## Instructions to Apply Fixes

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `create_tables.sql`
4. Execute the script

### Step 2: Restart Server

The server should be restarted to pick up the new routes:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test API Endpoints

Test the following endpoints:

1. **Blog Comments**: `GET /api/blogs/future-of-ai-recent-updates/comments/threaded`
2. **Blog Likes Count**: `GET /api/interactions/blogs/future-of-ai-recent-updates/likes/count`
3. **Blog Bookmarks Count**: `GET /api/interactions/blogs/future-of-ai-recent-updates/bookmarks/count`
4. **Blog Events**: Should now work without 400 errors

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. ✅ Blog comments API should return 200 instead of 500
2. ✅ Blog likes/bookmarks API should return 200 instead of 500
3. ✅ Blog events tracking should work without 400 errors
4. ✅ All interaction features (like, bookmark, comment) should work properly

## Files Modified

1. `server/controllers/blogCommentsController.js` - Added threaded comments and fixed blog ID handling
2. `server/routes/blogComments.js` - Added threaded comments route
3. `create_tables.sql` - Database schema for all missing tables
4. `BLOG_INTERACTIONS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Notes

- The unified interactions controller was already correctly implemented
- The main issue was missing database tables
- Blog events tracking was failing due to missing `blog_events` table
- All tables use blog slugs as `blog_id` for consistency with the existing blog system
